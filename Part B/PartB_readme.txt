It is a Music Label website where users can view their favorite artist's work online.
The site lands on the Home page, which previews the artist's new releases with audio, featured video, subscribe option and navigates to two other pages,
- ARTISTS : a page which previews the artists' names and images.
- VIDEOS : a page which previews the music videos created by the artists.
